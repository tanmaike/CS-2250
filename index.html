                <p class="generaltext">These Sugar Cookies are a party of favority of many, with a rich flavor that's complemented by a light sweetness. I've made these treats dozens of times, and every time, they're gone within the hour.</p>
                <p class="generaltext">These cookies are highly reliant on its main ingredient: cocoa powder. It's best to not concede to using a cheaper cocoa. The richer the cocoa, the deeper the flavor. I personally recommend using <a class="insertedlink" href="https://shop.kingarthurbaking.com/items/black-cocoa">King Arthur Baking Company's Black Cocoa</a>. Its wonderful flavor is made even more wonderful by its fair price.</p>

                    <p class="sidetext">Hi! My name is <em>Miah</em>, though most people online call me <em>Tan</em>. I'm a student at Cal Poly Pomona, where I major in CompSci. I may be good at coding, but I'm also good at baking, a hobby I developed during a semester where I took all of my classes at home. I started with brownies, and got into cookies soon after.</p>

                <p class="generaltext">While these cookies are simple, the small nuances of baking do make the difference between a decent cookie and an amazing cookie. Things like letting dough rest in the fridge and not overdeveloping your cookie dough really make all the difference. Check it out!</p>
